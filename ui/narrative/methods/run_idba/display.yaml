    <p>This is a KBase wrapper for IDBA-UD.</p>
    <p>IDBA-UD is an iterative graph-based assembler for single-cell and standard short read data. IDBA-UD is an extension of IDBA algorithm and is good for data of highly uneven sequencing depth. In its assembly process, IDBA-UD iterates from small k to a large k. In each iteration, short and low-depth contigs are removed iteratively with cutoff threshold from low to high to reduce the errors in low-depth and high-depth regions. This iterative approach compensates for the information loss with de bruijn graphs constructed using a single kmer length. For this reason, IDBA-UD is considered one of the more accurate microbial assemblers.</p>
    <p><b>Known limitations</b>: IDBA-UD only works with paired-end reads, as they are are aligned to contigs and assembled locally to generate some missing k-mers in low-depth regions.</p>
