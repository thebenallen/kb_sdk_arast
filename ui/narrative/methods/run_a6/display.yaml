    <p>This is a KBase wrapper for A6.</p>
    <p>A6 is an Argonne modified version of the original A5 microbial assembly pipeline created by Aaron Darling's group. A5 is good for high-quality microbial genome assembly and does so without the need for parameter tuning on the part of the user. It is an integrated meta-assembly pipeline consisting of the following steps and tools: (1) Read cleaning with TagDust; (2) Error correction with SGA; (3) Contig assembly with IDBA-UD; (4) Crude scaffolding with SSPACE; (5) Misassembly correction based on read mapping using Bowtie; and (6) Final scaffolding with stringent parameters reparing previously broken contigs. A6's modifications over A5 include a bug fix in detecting Phred64 quality coding and replacing IDBA with IDBA-UD for improved assembly accuracy and stability.</p>
    <p><b>Known limitations</b>: A6 is known to crash on some datasets due to the vulnerability associated with integrating a large number of third-party tools in its workflow. Due to a compatibility issue, A6 is known to not work on the example read library <i>rhodo.art.q20.int.PE.reads</i>. This is because the simulated read library has stretched quality scores that do not play well with the SGA component in error correction. Another example paired-end library <i>rhodo.art.q10.PE.reads</i>, however, should work in this method.</p>
