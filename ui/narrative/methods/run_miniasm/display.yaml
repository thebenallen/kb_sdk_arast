    <p>This is a KBase wrapper for MiniASM.</p>
    <p>MiniASM is an ultra-fast overlap-layout-consensus based de novo assembler for noisy long reads developed by Heng Li. It has been shown to assemble ~50X microbial PacBio reads into a draft assembly of a small number of (sometimes 1) contigs in a matter of minutes. MiniASM derives this performance from a locality-sensitive hashing based overlapper implemented in minimap.</p>
    <p><b>Known limitations</b>: MiniASM does not support short Illumina reads. MiniASM is still in early development stage, and has only been tested on a dozen of PacBio and Oxford Nanopore bacterial data sets. The consensus sequence computed by MiniASM may not be as accurate as slower and more mature methods such as HGAP3.</p>
